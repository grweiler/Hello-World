I am a beginner trying to get stated with programing an Arduino Uno. 
The code stored her is not original, but rather modified versions of downloads of sample code from a variety of sources that I hope to modify for my purposes.
The batches of code are called Sketches
The Libraries used are provided by the manufacurer of a component or fron other Arduino owners sharing code
I am using Git hub because Popolu, the manufacuturer of the LED strip, puts there Sketches here.
